I looked into the microsft exchange server data breach from 2021. The "bad guys" were able to hack into the exchange servers and steal business and personal data. 
They were able to do this buy attacking certain vulnerabilities in the code. I could not find exactly what the hackers did, but they were able to use certain scripts
to get in and leave a kernal behind so they could come back later. Microsoft was able to patch the issue out of their system, but if the companies effected did not
update their equipment they would still be suseptable to the attacks.
